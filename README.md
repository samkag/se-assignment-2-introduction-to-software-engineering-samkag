# SE-Assignment-2

Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? Sotfware engineering is the application of different methods and tools to come up with efficient software. Software engineering is different from traditional programming because it entails step and procedures that are to be followed systematically to see the development process meet a time line etc.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
SDLC is essential to delivering high quality software products that meets the user needs.
Below are different phases of software Development Life Cycle;
1. Planning - define project scope, requirements, objectives and constraints. 
2. Analysis - gather and analyze user needs, develop functional and technicla specifications. 
3. Design - Design the system's architecture, components, and interfaces. 
4. Implementation - writing code based on need and design. 
5. Testing - checking whether the solution works to solve the problem effectively. 
6. Deployment - Giving the solution to the customers. 
7. Maintenance - Providing continuous support to keep the software running. 
8. Retirement - plan for end-life of the software and archive source code and documentation of the software.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Waterfall model is rigid i.e.each step of development has to be completed before moving on to the next, requires upfront detailed specification, less flexible, teams are assigned specific tasks extensive documentation is produced throughout the process. While Agile projects are broken down into smaller iterations and allowing for continous improvemnt, customers are actively involved throughout the development process, allows changes to done quickly and easily, teams can work on their own and there is frequent communication to ensure alignment.
Agile is preferred with projects that are uncertain and require rapid changing.
Waterfall is preferred with projects that are well-defined, stable, clear scope and time line.

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. Requirements engineering referes to the systematic and structured process that defines, captures and manages the requirements of a system or software.
Process of requiremnts engineering is as follows

1. Elicitation - gathering requiremnts
2. Analysis - understanding and refining requiremnts
3. Documentation - formally specifying the requiremnts
4. Management - controlling requirements changes throughout development
   Importance in SDL
5. Creates clear foundation for system design
6. It reduces development cost
7. Improves user satisfaction
8. Ensures proper communication
9. Support agile development
10. Ensures regulatory compliance
11. Provide basis for testing

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design.
Modularity in Software Design: Modularity refers to the concept of organizing software systems into independent, cohesive, and loosely coupled modules or components. It aims to enhance software quality, maintainability, and flexibility.
How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? It reduces complexity, enahnces reusability, imporves maintainability, increases flexibility, and improves testability.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing

1. Unit testing - is the process of testing individual components of the program.
2. Integration testing - testing process that validates how different software modules interact with each other.
3. System testing acceptance testing - is the quality assurance process that validates whether the software meets the requirements and specifications.
   Why is testing crucial in software development? To ensure that the software solves the problem to its core.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version Control Systems (VCS's) are tools that allows multiple users to work on the same project simulteneously that enables tracking changes and collaborate effectively. Examples; Centralized VCS they stores all repo data in a central server (e.g. Subversions, Perforce) and Distributed VCS they store copies of repos on each users computer allowing offline work and peer-to-peer collaboration (e.g. git and Mercurial)

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? Role of software manager is to lead a team of software development to achieve its goals. Responsibility of a Software project manager (SPM) to ensure the scope, time and budget is meet.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance refers to the process of checking faults, improve performance, or to adapt the system to a changed environment. Types of maintenance activities include corrective maintenance(used to fix bugs), Adaptive maintenance (used to adapt system changes like hardware or OS), protective maintenance (used to improve performance), and preventive maintenance (used to prevent future problems)

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? Privacy and data scurity (user data privacy), Bias and fairness (avoid creation of softwares that show bias and descrimination), artificial intelligence and Autonomy (Ensuring accountability and explainability of AI decisons) etc.
How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? Ensure that there is proper communication, agile methodologies, priotization of tasks and regular reassesment of project goals and timelines.
